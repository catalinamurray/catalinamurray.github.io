                    <br>
                    <p> One of the main properties of a textile is its composition, a critical piece of information for any garment designer or manufacturer. <span> Fabric content </span> can usually only be determined through extensive testing which is both costly and time-consuming. I proposed a new method that uses computer vision techniques to determine fabric composition with <span>images alone. </span>  </p>

                    <p> This method utilizes the textural properities of the different fabric blends to classify them. Specifically it uses <span> Local Binary Patterns </span> and the <span> Gray Level Covariance Matrix. </span> </p>

                    <br>
                    <p> Data was collected from two different fabric stores as well as from various clothing items. An iPhone camera was used to collect all the images. To achieve an adequately trained model images could only be taken of textile types that had multiple content blends as well as multiple fabric samples. Images were collected from 6 different categories of fabric: <span> Denim, Faux Leather, Fleece, Knit, linen, and Outdoor fabric.</span> Each category had 2-3 different fabric content make-ups.  </p>

                    <p> To enhance the texture of each image, the images were processed using <span> adaptive histogram equalization.</span> This technique helps improve the local contrast of an image by computing several histograms in each region of the image and redistributing the luminance values.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> Since Data was limited, the images were also <span> augmented </span> to improve the generalization of the model. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p> Both Local Binary Patterns and Gray Level Co-occurrence matricies were used. <span> LBP </span> is a way to compute a local representation of texture features. To do this the center pixel is compared to the surrounding pixel, a value is then set based on whether the center value is greater than or less than the surroudning value. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix <span> (GLCM) </span> is another popular method used to help extract the textural features of an image. Various properties can be calculated using an inputted spatial relationship.</p>

                    <p> <span> Principal Component Analysis </span> was used to reduce the dimensions and to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Since there is a limited number of images per fabric type there was a strong chance of overfitting. </p>

                    <p> SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN were all compared as clustering algorithms. The hyperparameters for each model were tuned for the best results. In the end <span> KNN </span> was seen as the most successful clustering algorithm for this data, however it would be interesting to see what the results would be with more data. Other nerual networks like the ResNet 18 were also evaulated but further investigation needs to be done.  </p>

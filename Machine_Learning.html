                <br>
                <p> One of the main properties of a textile is its composition, a critical piece of information for any garment designer or manufacturer. Fabric content can usually only be determined through extensive testing which is both costly and time-consuming. I proposed a new method that uses computer vision techniques to determine fabric composition with images alone.  </p>

                <p> The method utilizes Local Binary Patterns and Gray Level Covariance Matrices to extract the textural features of each image. K-nearest neighbors, a non-parametric supervised learning method is then used to classify the images based on content. An evaluation was done on 15 different fabric blends in six different fabric groups, the method achieved accuracy between 89-100%.</p>

                    <p> Data was collected from two different fabric stores as well as from various clothing items. An iPhone camera was used to collect all the images. To achieve an adequately trained model images could only be taken of textile types that had multiple content blends as well as multiple fabric samples. Images were collected from 6 different categories of fabric: Denim, Faux Leather, Fleece, Knit, linen, and Outdoor fabric. Each category had 2-3 different fabric content make-ups.  </p>
